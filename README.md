# Medical Symptom Checker (Pure Python)

**Humanized description**
This project is a friendly, easy-to-run, rule-based *Medical Symptom Checker* written entirely in pure Python — no external packages required. It asks the user simple questions, collects symptoms, and returns likely conditions with human-friendly suggestions: self-care, see a doctor, or emergency.

## What it does
- Interactively collects patient age, emergency/red-flag signs, and a list of symptoms.
- Scores possible conditions from a small built-in knowledge base using weighted symptom-match logic.
- Returns a clear, human-readable recommendation and top matched conditions.


## Files included
- `symptom_checker.py` — The main program (pure Python).
- `README.md` — This file.
- `project_report.pdf` — Project report (humanized) — also included as plain text fallback.
- `mini_project_report.txt` — Plain text version of the report.
- `medical_symptom_checker_project.zip` — ZIP archive containing the project.

## How to run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open a terminal (or command prompt).
3. Run:
```
python symptom_checker.py
```
4. Follow on-screen prompts. Type `done` when finished entering symptoms.

## Customization & extension ideas
- Expand the knowledge base with more conditions and more precise symptom phrasing.
- Add probability calibration using real datasets.
- Export results to a file or integrate with a simple GUI (Tkinter or web interface).
- Add language support or localization for non-English prompts.

## Important notes and disclaimers
This tool is educational and for demonstration purposes only. It is **not medical advice**. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.


Thank you — enjoy exploring and improving the checker!
